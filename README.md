## My process

With how the submit button makes the view changes I thought react would help me achieve that look and how there will be a state
management with the clicked rating number to be used on the second card view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

One can use a conditional operator to display a different component
